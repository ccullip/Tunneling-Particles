An interactive look into the particle in a box experiment. 

Change the particle's kinetic energy and the width of the potential energy barrier to see how it would travel in 1-dimension. Turn on and off the tunneling probability to see how the particle's energy decays as it penetrates through the barrier.

At the end of the short interactive, there will be an example and a few questions to test what you've learned!

Tunnel on!
