        <p>Intro to particles, should have experience with particles, waves, etc, know about protons/electrons</p>
        <p><b>ANIMATION: MOVING PARTICLES</b></p>
        <p>What about a particle confined to a box Potential energy is 0 inside the box and rises abruptly to infinity at the sides of the box, effectively confining the particle to inside the box. The wavefunction for this particle is defined as Psi = Ae^ikx + Be^-ikx. The A term describes the motion to the right of the wave and the B term describes the motion to the left of the wave.</p>

        <p>But what if the potential energy is still higher that the kinetic energy but not infinity? Well... This leads to tunneling! Quantum theory states that particles are able to tunnel through the walls if V>E, with the kinetic energy decaying as it tunnels. Tunneling is not guaranteed, however. When a particle reaches a boundary with V>E but V != infinity, it can either continue through the wall or be reflected and change direction. This can be described by the tunneling probability: INSERT EQUATION.</p>

        <p>As the potential energy approaches the kinetic energy, the probability of tunneling increases based on the tunneling probability formula.</p>
        <p>If the potential energy barrier isn't infinitely wide, then the proton can tunnel through the barrier and continue moving on the other side.</p>
        <p><b>ANIMATION: DECREASE BARRIER WIDTH, PARTICLE TUNNELS THROUGH WALL, CONTINUES ON</b></p>
        <p>If the potential energy barrier is lower than the kinetic energy of the particle, the particle will just travel over the barrier without a problem.</p>
        <p><b>ANIMATION: LOWER BARRIER SIZE, PARTICLE TRAVELS OVER BARRIER</b></p>
        <p>Now what happens if we use a proton instead of an electron? As mass increaes, the likelihood of tunneling decreases--probably the reason why you've never seen a human travel through a wall! (is this true?)</p>
        <p><b>ANIMATION: CHANGE SIZE OF PARTICLE</b></p>
        <p>Electron tunneling appears in many areas of science such as LIST AREAS, and has some incredibly important implications such as FIX ME. By futhering our understanding of quantum theory we discover more and more about the rules that define our world at a nanoscopic level. I've compiled all of the various aspects of particle tunneling into one simulation--feel free to play around and see what you can discover!</p>
